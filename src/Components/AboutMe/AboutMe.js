          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a veteran and student, currently working on cloud projects. I am
            using this website as a way to present some of the tasks I'm working
            on while I study for the Linux+ and RedHat Certified System
            Administrator exams.
            <br />
            <br />
            I began working with computers as a kid, learning a lot about PCs by
            breaking and rebuilding them, so that I could play video games. In
            the military, I worked with a lot of different radios and technical
            gear that enabled me and my team to be successful operating in
            austere environments.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now, I'm interested in building and securing cloud infrastructure
            and cybersecurity. In my free time I enjoy learning and building new
            projects, exercising, mountain biking, and hiking.
