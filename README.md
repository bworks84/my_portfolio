## Overview

I am building out a portfolio site with multiple pages, including a new resume page for the Cloud Resume Challenge, possibly a blog, and more front-end options using React.

I mainly wanted to start building projects as a way to show what I can do and break up the studying for Linux+....

I will host this site on AWS and document my progress/challenges utilizing the blog

I also want to integrate Github's CoPilot on this project to begin learning more about it and how I can use it in future projects
